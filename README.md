        abstract = "Crop improvement must accelerate to feed an increasing
                  human population in the face of environmental
                  changes. Including anticipated climatic changes with
                  genetic architecture in breeding programs could better
                  optimize improvement strategies. Combinations of drought
                  and nitrogen limitation already occur world-wide. We
                  therefore analyzed the genetic architecture underlying
                  the response of Zea mays to combinations of water and
                  nitrogen stresses. Recombinant inbreds were subjected to
                  nine combinations of the two stresses using an optimized
                  response surface design, and their growth was
                  measured. Three-dimensional response surfaces were fit
                  globally and to each polymorphic allele to determine
                  which genetic markers were associated with different
                  response surfaces. Three quantitative trait loci that
                  produced nonlinear surfaces were mapped. To better
                  understand the physiology of the response, we developed a
                  model that reproduced the shapes of the surfaces, their
                  most characteristic feature. The model contains two
                  components that each combine the nitrogen and water
                  inputs. The relative weighting of the two components and
                  the inputs is governed by five parameters, and each QTL
                  affects all five parameters. We estimated the model's
                  parameter values for the experimental surfaces using a
                  mesh of points that covered the surfaces' most
                  distinctive regions. Surfaces computed using these values
                  reproduced the experimental surfaces well, as judged by
                  three different criteria at the mesh points. The modeling
                  and shape comparison techniques used here can be extended
                  to other complex, high-dimensional, nonlinear
                  phenotypes. We encourage the application of our findings
                  and methods to experiments that mix crop protection
                  measures, stresses, or both, on elite and landrace
